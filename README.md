TankerPop: TinkerPop toolbelt built atop Docker Compose
====================

Build this project with Docker Compose and get a fully functional TinkerPop system to experiment with.

Includes...

 * Gremlin Server
 * Gremlin Console

Planned:

 * Clojure-based Gremlin script runtime and REPL
 * Titanium+Clojure base image
 * Gremlin Test Server, a Gremlin server for your test suite

All images are based on `library/clojure` (which is a descendant of `library/java`).
